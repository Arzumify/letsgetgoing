# Chapter 1: Welcome to Go!

Hello! Welcome to the Let's Get Going, a simple guide designed to make you a Go-expert by the end of our course.

This book is available in HTML format, and can also be downloaded to be read in PDF form from [our repository](https://github.com/arzumify/letsgetgoing/releases).

We will assume, for this book, that you are using a version of Go newer than at least Go 1.23[^1], and that you are running either a UNIX-like operating system (such as Linux or MacOS)[^2] or Microsoft Windows.

Ready? Then let's start off with installation!

[^1]: This is due to the addition of os.RemoveAll, which will be described in this book.
[^2]: Of course, It's doubtful Go will run on TempleOS.
